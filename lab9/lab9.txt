1. To find out how much disk space is used to represent the working files
in this directory, I cd'd into the directory and ran du

$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
$ du -sh --exclude .git

which gave 159M

To find how much disk space is used to represent the .git directory,
I ran

$ du -sh .git

which gave 350M

To find the largest files in the directory, I ran the following command which
lists the top ten files by disk space.

$ du -a . | sort -nr | head -n10

520828	.
358316	./.git
349928	./.git/objects
342032	./.git/objects/pack
318152	./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack
72680	./lisp
23876	./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.idx
20372	./src
16700	./doc
14656	./test

The largest non-directory file is
./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack
which has the size of 318152. It makes sense that this is the largest
file because git pack objects are essentially compressed data from merging
multiple files together. Not surprisingly, these files end up being
large.

2. To find how many branches are remote to the repository, I ran
$ git branch -r | wc -l
and found that there were 177 remote branches

To find how many branches were local, I ran
$ git branch -l | wc -l
and found that there were 176 local branches

3. There is one remote repository named origin. The url corresponding
to it is https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git I used git remote
to get the name of the remote and the -v option to see the url corresponding
to that remote repository.

$ git remote
$ git remote -v

4. The ten branches most recently committed to are the following

$ git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --count=10

	19aecd340b7b3ab54629b790ba70a90130bad63d commit	refs/remotes/origin/master
	19aecd340b7b3ab54629b790ba70a90130bad63d commit	refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
	19aecd340b7b3ab54629b790ba70a90130bad63d commit	refs/heads/master
	d2873706749ef68803e79bab6109a534f4c9d23a commit	refs/remotes/origin/scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function

	8a4de19dfb52551a65c360a9346ede137d0fc6e8 commit	refs/remotes/origin/scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal

5. The number of commits to master is 139583
$ git rev-list --count master

6. To find the percentage of all commits that are also in master branch, I
first found the total number of commits across all branches then found the
ratio of the number of commits specific to master to the number of total
commits.

$ git rev-list --all --count

gave the number of total commits, which was 143910. From the last question,
the number of commits in master is 139583

139583/143910 = 0.96993259676 ~ 97%

7. To find the ten people who authored the most commits 2013 or later, I ran
$ git shortlog -sn --since="01 Jan 2013"
and took the first 10 lines of the output, which lists the number of commits
made followed by the author

  3691  Eli Zaretskii
  3644  Glenn Morris
  3604  Paul Eggert
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1784  Stefan Monnier
  1571  Michael Albinus
   619  Dmitry Gutov
   576  Noam Postavsky
   471  Alan Mackenzie
   469  Juri Linkov


8. I logged out of the SEASnet servers and SSH'd back in with -X after
running Xquartz locally.

After searching each commit hash on gitk and examining its relative position
to the other specified commits, I was able to generate the following diagram:

                          c5
c1                       /
  \                   ... c6
   c2 - c3 ... c4 .../        \
                               c7         c9 ... c10
                                 \       /       /
                                   ... c8 ......  

I labelled each commit as follows:

4ea37c2b8b0c5a68fde59770c3536195e0972217 : c1
977cd6cb28a37744966ec62f70cf62659f6f302a : c2
