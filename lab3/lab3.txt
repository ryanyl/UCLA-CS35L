==========

1) Obtain coreutils-8.29 tar file
$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

obtain signature
$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

get GNU keyring
$ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

verify signature
$ gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

The verification indicates that it is a good signature from Pádraig Brady.
There is warning saying: "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner". This just 
means Pádraig Brady's public key is yet to be verified by you.

2) unzip and untar coreutils-8.29
$ tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

made directory where coreutils-8.29 would be installed
$ mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall

configure file with prefix tag
$ ./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/linr/coreutilsInstall

make and install
$ make
$ make install

3) Reproducing the bug:
$ cd ~/coreutilsInstall
$ mkdir foo
$ ./ls -a -A foo

./ls -a -A should have outputted nothing, since -A was the last option 
specified. However, ".." and "." were outputted, meaning that -a was
applied instead of -A.

4) Apply patch
I created the patch file $ emacs patch_file then copy and pasted
corresponding patches from the given patch file. I then applied
the patch with
$ patch -p1 < patch_file
Problems:
patch command outputted the following

  Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
  1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
  patching file src/ls.c
  Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).

The Hunk failed indicates that the patches made to NEWS were 
unsuccessful. Offset -3 lines indicates that patches were made starting
on lines 1900 instead of 1903 (where 1903 was indicated in patch_file). 
Although there were these discrepancies, I emacs'd into the modified 
file and confirmed that the patch was applied successfully.

5) Commands executed by make

CC means C compiled, so the command compiled src/ls.o
  CC       src/ls.o

CCLD means compile and link, so src/dir src/ls src/vdir
  CCLD     src/dir
  CCLD     src/ls
  CCLD     src/vdir

GEN generates manual pages for the following files: dir.1, ls.1, vdir.1
  GEN      man/dir.1
  GEN      man/ls.1
  GEN      man/vdir.1


6) Testing patched file
$ cd ~/coreutils-8.29/src
$ mkdir foo
$ ./ls -a -A foo
Outputs nothing, which indicates -A overrides -a. Patch successful.
