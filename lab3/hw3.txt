Q1) The patch improves the performane of the ls command because now
ls -a -A behaves as expected. It is also slightly faster because
we removed an if statement.

Q2) If my company relied on the old version of ls in their programs, the newly
patched version might affect the behaviour of the old programs. This would
require even more patches to files with ls in them originally.

Q3) When invoked on an empty file such as /dev/null, randline.py outputs
the following error message: list index out of range. This is because
/dev/null is a special filesystem object that throws away anything written
into it, which means it is always an empty file. Line 227 in randline.py

return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty

tries to index into an emtpy array, so randline.py will encounter an 
IndexError

Q4) randline.py, when run with python3, encounters a syntax error

    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
    ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This indicates that some syntax available in python were changed
or updated in python3.

Q5) When my script is invoked with Python 2 rather than Python 3,
my script behaves identically because everything I used that was
supported in in Python 3 was also supported in Python 2.
