Assignment 7
==========

1. I first obtained a copy of the Diffutils repository by running
$ cp ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils .

2. To get a log of changes I ran
$ git log > git-log.txt

3. To get a list of tags used for diff I ran
$ git tag > git-tags.txt

4. I use emacs find C-s to find the commit id corresponding to the title
“maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'”, then ran
$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt
to obtain the diff file associated with that particular commit id and 
saved the output into quote-patch.txt

5. To checkout version 3 of diffutils I ran
$ git checkout v3.0

6. To apply quote-patch.txt I ran
$ patch -p1 <quote-patch.txt

When the patch could not find a target file, I hit enter and skipped it.
Most hunks succeeded with a few rejects. The rejected hunks were outputted
to diff3.c.rej

7. running git status lists all modified and untracked files. The following
files were modified:

	modified:   NEWS
	modified:   README
	modified:   TODO
	modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
	modified:   ms/config.bat
	modified:   ms/config.site
	modified:   po/en.po
	modified:   src/analyze.c
	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/context.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff.h
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/ifdef.c
	modified:   src/io.c
	modified:   u src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/side.c
	modified:   src/system.h
	modified:   src/util.c
	modified:   tests/help-version

The temporary original copy that diff saves as well as the files containing
the rejected hunks are shown as untracked files since they were just created
and have not been git added.

	NEWS.orig
	README-hacking.orig
	README-hacking.rej
	README.orig
	README.rej
	cfg.mk.orig
	cfg.mk.rej
	git-log.txt
	git-tags.txt
	ms/config.site.orig
	quote-patch.txt
	src/cmp.c.orig
	src/context.c.orig
	src/diff.c.orig
	src/diff.c.rej
	src/diff.h.orig
	src/diff3.c.orig
	src/diff3.c.rej
	src/dir.c.orig
	src/sdiff.c.orig
	src/system.h.orig
	src/util.c.orig
	tests/help-version.orig

8. vc-diff (C-x v =) compares the workfiles with the original version
vc-revert (C-x v u) reverts the current version control file set to its last
revision. I opened a file modified by the patch and ran vc-diff then ran
C-h m (describe mode) which listed the commands I could use in the vc-diff
buffer. 

According to gnu.org,
diff-apply-hunk C-c C-a applies the hunk to its target files
diff-goto-source C-c C-c Goes to the source file and the lines 
corresponding to the hunk

9. I reverted all changes from non .c files by emacs'ing into each file
and doing C-x v u. To undo all non character-string changes in the .c
files, I examined each file in emacs using C-x v = and for each non
character-string change I saw in the diff buffer I reverted the change
manually in the corresponding .c file.

10. I examined diff.c.rej and diff3.c.rej and manually patched diff.c
and diff3.c by copying and pasting the corresponding changes according
to each of their .rej files.

11. To remove all untracked files I ran
$ git clean -n to first confirm the files I would be removing then ran
$ git clean -f to remove those files

12. git status now outputs:

	$ git status
	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/util.c

I then ran the following command, which outputted a patch file 300-400 lines
long into quote-3.0-patch.txt

$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. To build the modified version of diffutils, I followed README-hacking
and excecuted the following commands. I had to apply a separate patch 
because I was using lnxsrv07

$ ./bootstrap
$ emacs patchfile
*copied given patchfile into directory*
$ cd lib
$ patch < patchfile
$ cd ..
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

make check threw the following errors

make[3]: *** [Makefile:1309: basic.log] Error 126
make[3]: Leaving directory '/w/home.24/ee/ugrad/linr/cs35l/wk7/diffutils/tests'
make[2]: *** [Makefile:1291: check-TESTS] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory '/w/home.24/ee/ugrad/linr/cs35l/wk7/diffutils/tests'
make[1]: *** [Makefile:1406: check-am] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/w/home.24/ee/ugrad/linr/cs35l/wk7/diffutils/tests'
make: *** [Makefile:1016: check-recursive] Error 1

However, I ran "diff . -" and "diff --help" and both commands outputted what
was expected, telling me that those errors were not detrimental to the
performance of the modified diff.

Tests:
$ ./diff . -
./diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

Running diff --help outputs many lines so I only included the lines of
interest, namely those that had ` replaced with '

$ ./ diff --help

-D NAME  --ifdef=NAME  Output merged file to show '#ifdef NAME' diffs.
LTYPE is 'old', 'new', or 'unchanged'.  GTYPE is LTYPE or 'changed'.
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
If a FILE is '-', read standard input.

14. I did a sanity test by using the new diff to compare the source code
of Diffutils 3.0 to the source code of my modified version. To summarize
what I did, I first created two directories to store the source files
of the modified and original version. I then called the modified diff


$ cd ..
$ mkdir diffutils-3.0
$ mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch
$ cp diffutils/src/*.c diffutils-3.0-patch
$ cp ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils/src/*.c diffutils-3.0
$ diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt

15. quote-3.0-test.txt is much longer than quote-3.0-patch at 4626 lines. The 
files are clearly not identical. I emacs'd into quote-3.0-test and found
found that the changes made also consisted of replacing ` with ', showing
that while the files were different, the patch was successfully made.
