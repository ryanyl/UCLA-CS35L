HW 9
==========

1. Created a log to record actions in the homework
$ emacs hw9.txt

2. I checked out version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch called quote by
running
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. I installed my new change by running
$ patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt
There were no apparent errors.

4. add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) adds a new entry to the change
log file for the file you are editing

5. I used the emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window to add a
changelog entry to my patch file.

$ emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt
C-x 4 a

	* quote-3.0-patch.txt: This patch is a response to a change in the
    GNU coding standards, which now suggests quoting 'like this' or
    "like this", instead of `like this' or ``like this''. This change
    is only applied to character string constants in the c files.

C-x C-c

6. I then committed my changes to the new branch, using ChangeLog as
the commit message
$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

NOTE: I mistakenly git added and committed my quote-3.0-patch.txt so I
deleted it and git add and committed again, with Changelog as the commit
message

7. I used git format-patch to generate a patch that did not require anything
to be fixed by hand after the patch is applied.

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. I checked out version 3.0 again to a new branch that I named 'partner'.
I then exchanged patches with my parter through email, then applied his patch
and rebuilt the resulting system with git am. Partner: James Zhou

$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
$ git am < formatted-patch.txt
$ ./bootstrap
$ emacs patchfile
*copied given patchfile into directory*
$ cd lib
$ patch < patchfile
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

make check threw the same errors as when I ran make check in the lab:

make[3]: *** [Makefile:1309: basic.log] Error 126
make[3]: Leaving directory '/w/home.24/ee/ugrad/linr/cs35l/wk7/diffutils/tests'
make[2]: *** [Makefile:1291: check-TESTS] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory '/w/home.24/ee/ugrad/linr/cs35l/wk7/diffutils/tests'
make[1]: *** [Makefile:1406: check-am] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/w/home.24/ee/ugrad/linr/cs35l/wk7/diffutils/tests'
make: *** [Makefile:1016: check-recursive] Error 1

However, I ran "diff . -" and "diff --help" and both commands outputted what
was expected, telling me that those errors were not detrimental to the
performance patched diff

I tested the following commands as before and sure enough, all the ` were 
replaced with ', signaling a successful patch. I did not list out the 
lengthy output of ./diff --help, and instead only included the lines
that formerly contained ` and now replaced with '.

$ cd src
$ ./diff . -
./diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

$ ./diff --help
LTYPE is 'old', 'new', or 'unchanged'.  GTYPE is LTYPE or 'changed'.
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions on FILES.
If a FILE is '-', read standard input.

9. To verify that the ChangeLog entry works, I ran
$ make distdir
and cd'd into the newly created directory diffutils-3.0.1-533c
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-533c
From there, I emacs'd into the ChangeLog file and saw my partner's
ChangeLog entry at the top of this file, indicating that his
entry worked.

10. I logged out, downloaded Xming, and then ssh into the server with
X11 forwarding enabled and the display variable set to :0.0. I then
cd'd into ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and then ran gitk, which opened
a window with multiple subwindows. The top left shows a diagram
representation of all the git actions done to the remote repository, to
the left of that contains the timestamp and information of the
person who made that action. Below are two windows, one showing the
diff file and changelog corresponding to the selected change and
one containing the git tree/patch.

I scrolled all the way down to 2015-01-25 to find the newest merge
no newer than 2015-01-25. I found a merge by Joakim Verona who merged
into master on 2015-01-24 17:11:31
