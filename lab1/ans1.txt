1.
$ man -k [expression]
commands used:
$ man man

2.
sh is located in /usr/bin/bash
mv is located in /usr/bin/mv
commands used:
$ man whereis
$ whereis sh
$ whereis mv
$ readlink /usr/bin/sh
$ readlink /usr/bin/mv

3.
ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
pr - convert text files for printing
tr - translate or delete characters
commands used:
$ man -k ^.r$

4. 
resolved symbolic link: /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
used readlink twice to resolve chain of symbolic links 
commands used:
$ man readlink
$ readlink /usr/bin/emacs
$ readlink /etc/alternatives/emacs

5.
gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39) (GCC)
gcc version 9.2.0 (GCC) 
They are different because different versions of GCC can exist in different paths on the
same machine. The GCC stored in /usr/bin is outdated while the plain GCC program is.
commands used:
$ gcc -v
$ /usr/bin/gcc -v

6.
u+sx sets the execute and setuid modes for the user.
o-w unsets the write mode for others (users who are neither the owner nor members of the file's group).
commands used:
$ man chmod

7.
Output (first five):
.
./src/bison
./src/bison/RCS
./src/gnuplot
./src/gnuplot/RCS
commands used:
$ cd /usr/local/cs
$ man find
$ find . -type d -mtime -28

8.
253 symbolic links (lnxsrv07) 
commands used:
$ whereis find
$ cd /usr/bin
$ find -type l > ~/temp.txt
$ cd
$ emacs temp.txt
scrolled to bottom of temp.txt and inspected last line number

9.
librom1394.so.0.3.0
commands used:
$ cd /usr/lib64
$ man ls
$ ls -t -a -l

10. locale gets its information from /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive, which is the usual default locale archive location
commands used:
$ man locale

11.
downcase-dwim
downcase-region
downcase-word
commands used:
$ emacs
(emacs) C-h r
(emacs) C-h a downcase

12.
C-M r Begin reverse incremental regexp search ('isearch-backward-regexp')
C-M s Begin incremental regexp search ('isearch-forward-regexp')
C-M t Switches the positions of the previous balanced expression and the next one ('transpose sexps')
C-M u Move up in parenthesis structure ('backward-up-list')
C-M v scrolls the window that 'C-x o' would select ('scroll-other-window')
commands used:
$ emacs
(emacs) C-h K C-M r
(emacs) C-h K C-M s
(emacs) C-h K C-M t
(emacs) C-h K C-M u
(emacs) C-h K C-M v

13.
C-g signals a quit condition. C-g is the way to get rid of a partially typed command,
or a numeric argument that you don't want. Furthermore, if you are in the middle of a 
command, C-g stops the command in a relatively safe way.
commands used:
(emacs) C-h K C-r

14.
yanking means reinserting text previously killed; can be invoked with C-y
commands used:
(emacs) C-h w yank
(emacs) C-h K C-y

15.
ls -l does not list files beginning with '.', while the emacs dired command does. The coloring of files are also different; the dired command shows files and directories in white while ls -l shows directories as white and files as green.
commands used:
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -l
(emacs) C-h dired
(emacs) C-x d /usr/bin
